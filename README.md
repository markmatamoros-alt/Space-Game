My programming contributions pertained to Unity's Arduino integration. 
It must be noted that the Uduino plugin was utilized for communcation.

While I am the author of the Arduino script for the both client and server setups and the script for independent control testing, I assisted with the development of these Unity-related files: 

  *Unity Space Game -> Assets -> ArduinoServerController.cs

  *Unity Space Game -> Assets -> Scripts -> Controller -> ArduinoController.cs

  *Unity Space Game -> Assets -> Scripts -> Controller -> MainSeceneController.cs

  *Unity Space Game -> Assets -> Scripts -> Controller -> PlayerSceneController.cs

It must be noted that I authored all game documentation.
